## About

The program PhoTo was created for the purpose of handling pictures properly. It was made in about 2 months to ensure the optimal experience for the users. 
It has some functions that you can handle the picture with, including rotation, flipping or various filters.
The functions are easily accessible and organised by the panels that have been created to the bottom of the program. 
Just click on the button of the function that you want to apply, it is that simple.
Handling the files has been made dynamically as well, you can reach any of your pictures (as long as they are supported extention-wise). 
No matter where they are in the computer! You do not have to handle this task with a static folder. You also have 2 types of saves avaliable.

The program was created by three ambitious young people as a Project for their Programming 1 course.
Thank you for taking a look at it.
